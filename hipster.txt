I just heard it come on. No, no, that's the music you heard when it come on. You know, it's high tide. But we're not on the coast. I'm closed for maintenance! Closed for maintenance? I've fallen to the communists! Well, they do have some strong arguments. I'll put this over here, with the rest of the fire.
